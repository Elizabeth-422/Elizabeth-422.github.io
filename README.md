# About Me
## My Interests/Hobbies: 
* Running
   * A couple things that I enjoy about running is that it gives me the opportunity to go outside and clear my head. Another thing I like about it is that it helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle.
* Reading
   * What I like about reading is that it allows me to keep my brain active while still relaxing. A couple books I'm reading right now are *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen and *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley.
* Baking
   * Baking has always been a hobby of mine because I enjoy trying and experimenting with new and different recipes. My favorite thing to make is [chocolate chip cookies](https://sugarspunrun.com/worst-chocolate-chip-cookies/).
* Pilates
  * Pilates is recent hobby I've taken up. I really like it because increases my flexibility and core strength, and beginning everyday with movement has helped me be more productive and have more energy throughout the day.
